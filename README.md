### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on mobile apps with Flutter, Andriod and iOS, also my [YouTube coding channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz0IhLYLaiaZ7D9_U301S9Q) and a couple of personal projects

- ðŸŒ± Occasionally contributing to open source projects, but majorly I spend my extra time on developing own projects and realizing own ideas.
- ðŸ‘¯ Sometimes speaking at meetups and conferences, but only if I know I have something interesting to say. Last time I spoke at Flutter Munich Meetup about working with MIDI in Flutter
- âš¡Content creator, mostly in form of videos, but time to time I open yet another blog... then I kill it... ;)

## I code you to death YT Channel

Check out my Youtube channel where I'm talking about (mostly) topics related to mobile development. It's a channel focused primarly on the code and not necessarly for beginners, but I hope everyone can find something interesting over there!
